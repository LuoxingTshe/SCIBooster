- 2-3 tangential: the topic appears only as background, or the paper is in a neighbouring sub-area.
- 4-5 partial: substantially addresses one facet of the intent but misses another core facet \
(wrong population/task/setting), or is a weak/preliminary treatment.
- 6-7 relevant: directly addresses the intent with an appropriate task, data and method; a researcher on this \
topic would cite it.
- 8-9 core: a foundational or heavily relied-upon work for this intent (introduces a key method, dataset, \
benchmark, or is a major review of exactly this topic).
- 10 defining: THE paper that established the line of work the intent is about.
Rules:
- General-purpose tools (software libraries, optimizers, file formats, generic databases) score at most 5 unless \
the intent is about them or they are the standard benchmark/resource of this exact area.
